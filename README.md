# Object Detection Example

This is a simple project that demonstrates the usage of Next.js with TypeScript, GrommetJS, FireBase Auth that provides object detection based on image file uploaded by user.

Separately, it is powered by a backend application called vision-backend-app that is powered by NodeJS, ExpressJS, AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, and Google Vision API.

# Notes

Still requires some refactoring and code clean up.
